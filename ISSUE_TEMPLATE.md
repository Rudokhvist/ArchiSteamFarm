I fully read and understood contributing guidelines of ASF available above, especially the point that GITHUB IS NOT TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND IT'S THE PLACE ONLY FOR ASF BUGS AND SUGGESTIONS.

I admit that THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OR TECHNICAL ISSUE caused by my lazyness of reading ASF wiki. I strongly believe that the bug I'm reporting here affects majority of ASF users, and the enhancement I'm suggesting could benefit ASF in long-run.

If my issue is not meeting contributing guidelines specified above, especially if it's a question or technical issue, please close my issue immediately - I won't complain.

## Suggestion

### Purpose

<!-- Detailed suggestion explanation - what should be implemented and what it should do, as well as expected usage and benefits. -->

### How can ASF users benefit from this suggestion?

<!-- You're not suggesting things only for yourself, so explain to us how it's going to be useful for everyone. -->

### Why currently available solutions are not sufficient?

<!-- If something you're suggesting is already possible, then explain to us why current solution is not sufficient. -->

### Does your suggestion fall into ASF scope?

<!-- Is ASF really the proper tool to include your enhancement in the first place? Is it connected with idling Steam cards? -->
