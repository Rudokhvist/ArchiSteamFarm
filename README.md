ArchiSteamFarm
===================

ASF is a C# application that allows you to farm steam cards using multiple steam accounts simultaneously. Unlike idle master which works only on one account at given time, requires steam client running in background, and launches additional processes imitiating "game playing" status, ASF doesn't require any steam client running in the background, doesn't launch any additional processes and is made to handle unlimited steam accounts at once. In addition to that, it's meant to be run on servers or other desktop-less machines, and features full Mono support, which makes it possible to launch on any Mono-supported operating system, such as Windows, Linux or OS X. ASF is based on, and possible, thanks to [SteamKit2](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit).

ASF doesn't require and doesn't interfere in any way with Steam client. In addition to that, it no longer requires exclusive access to given account, which means that you can use your main account in Steam client, and use ASF for farming the same account at the same time. If you decide to launch a game, ASF will get disconnected, and resume farming once you finish playing your game, being as transparent as possible.

**Core features:**

- Automatically farm available games using any number of active accounts
- Automatically accept friend requests sent from master
- Automatically accept all trades coming from master
- Automatically accept all steam cd-keys sent via chat from master
- Possibility to choose the most efficient cards farming algorithm, based on given account
- SteamGuard / SteamParental / 2FA support
- Unique ASF 2FA mechanism allowing ASF to act as mobile authenticator (if needed)
- ASF update notifications
- Full Mono support, cross-OS compatibility

**Setting up:**

Each ASF bot is defined in it's own XML config file in `config` directory. ASF comes with included ```example.xml``` config file, on which you should base all of your bots. Simply copy ```example.xml``` to a new file, and edit properties inside. Don't forget to switch ```Enabled``` property to ```true``` once you're done, as this is the master switch which enables configured bot to launch. The most minimalistic setup to make ASF working is changing only ```Enabled```, ```SteamLogin``` and ```SteamPassword``` properties, everything else is more or less optional to enable additional features.

After you set up all your bots (their configs), you should launch ```ASF.exe```. If your accounts require additional steps to unlock, such as Steam guard code, you'll need to enter those too after ASF tries to launch given bot. If everything ended properly, you should notice in the console output, as well as on your Steam, that all of your bots automatically started cards farming.

ASF doesn't require and doesn't interfere in any way with Steam client, which means that you can be logged in to Steam client as your primary account, and launch ASF at the same time, for any number of accounts, including your main one (if needed).

**Current Commands:**

- `!2fa` Generates temporary 2FA token for current bot instance
- `!2fa <BOT>` Generates temporary 2FA token for given bot instance
- `!2faoff` Deactivates 2FA for current bot instance
- `!2faoff <BOT>` Deactivates 2FA for given bot instance
- `!exit` Stops whole ASF
- `!farm` Restarts cards farming module. ASF automatically executes that if any cd-key is successfully claimed
- `!farm <BOT>` Restarts cards farming module for specified bot instance.
- `!redeem <KEY>` Redeems cd-key on current bot instance.
- `!redeem <BOT> <KEY>` Redeems cd-key on specified bot instance.
- `!start <BOT>` Starts given bot instance
- `!status` Prints current status of current bot.
- `!status <BOT>` Prints current status of specified bot.
- `!status all` Prints current status of all running bots.
- `!stop` Stops current bot instance
- `!stop <BOT>` Stops given bot instance
- `<KEY>` Redeems cd-key on current bot instance.
- `<LIST OF NEWLINE-SEPARATED KEYS>` Redeem keys on all running bots (limited by a number of keys, of course).

> Commands can be executed via a private chat with your bot.
> Remember that bot accepts commands only from ```SteamMasterID```. That property can be configured in the config.

**Supported / Tested Operating-Systems:**

 - Windows 10 Professional/Enterprise Edition (Native)
 - Windows 8.1 Professional (Native)
 - Windows 7 Ultimate (Native)
 - Debian 9.0 Stretch (Mono)
 - Debian 8.1 Jessie (Mono)
 - OS X 10.11.1 (Mono)
 
However, any operating system [listed here](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/supported-platforms/) should run ASF flawlessly.
